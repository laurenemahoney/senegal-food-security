# senegal-food-security
Produced spatial mapping of hotspots of food insecurity in Senegal using WFP VAM survey data. 
This work was conducted as a part of a summer internship with the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) ACToday Senegal division in partnership with the World Food Programme (WFP).

##Datasets Used: 
* WFP VAM Survey Data: Household survey data collected internmittently by various intergovernmental organizations from 2009-2019, and gathered by WFP for a Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA). Measured food insecurty by 3 Indices: the Food Consumption Score (FCS), the Food Expenditure Share (FES) and the Reduced Coping Strategies Index (rCSI); Accessed through the IRI Data Library. 
* Precipitation Data: ANACIM Daily timeseries dataset aggregated over department; *1981-2016*; Measured wet spells, dry spells, and rainfall onset. Reconstructed rainfall on a 0.0375 x 0.0375 lat/lon grid (about 4km) by combining quality-controlled station observations in ANACIM's archive with satellite rainfall estimates [available here] (http://213.154.77.59/maproom/Climatology/Climate_Analysis/daily_precip.html)
* Disaster Data: Flood and drought data from DesInventar available from *1993-2014*; DesInventar Dry Spell data only for 2013 and 2014 years; EMDAT from 2008- present [available here] (https://www.desinventar.net/) and [here] (https://public.emdat.be/)
* Food Price Data: WFP Monthly data for the period *2000-2020* at the market level.
* Food Production Data: WFP Crop yield dataset of all cereals in Senegal  at the department level, for the period *1961-2013*.
